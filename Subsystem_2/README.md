This is the README for the Subsystem_2
=======

*Contains minimisation code (boiler_fmincon_code.m), and graphical representations of how current, resistivity, length and radius affect the objective function (current_length_test_code.m and raduis_resistivity_test.m) *


Main script 
-------
The boiler_fmincon_code.m MATLAB script should be run to see results.

For graphical representation of how Current, length, resistivity or radius affect the power output please run current_length_test_code.m and raduis_resistivity_test.m

The CES file shows how the material was chosen, to determin the varible 'Resistivity'. 

Execution time
-------
The execution time is approximately 2 seconds

Dependencies
-------
The script requires only MATLAB_R2018A
