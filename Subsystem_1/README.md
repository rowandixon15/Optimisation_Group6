This is the README for the Subsystem_1
=======

Main script 
-------
Only the subsystem_1.m MATLAB script needs to be run, it will automatically bring up all graphs. If you want to find the results of the individual optimisation problems, those particular sections of the script should be run individually, once the whole script has been run.

Execution time
-------
The execution time is approximately 0.1 milliseconds

Dependencies
-------
The script requires only MATLAB_R2018A (the script will also possibly be compatible with earlier versions of MATLAB too).
